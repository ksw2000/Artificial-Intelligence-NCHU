# Constraint Satisfaction Problem

A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) consists of 3 components, X, D, and C

+ X is a set of variables
+ D is a set of domains
+ C is a set of constrains that specify allowable combinations of values

Each domain $D_i$ consists of a set of allowable values, {$v_1$, ..., $v_k$} for variable $X_i$. EA
