# Function optimization

If the path to the goal does not matter, we might consider a different class of algorithms, ones that do not worry about paths at all.

**Logical search** algorithms operate using a single current node rather than multiple paths and generally move only to neighbours of that node.

## Hill climbing

Hill climbing is simply a loop that continually moves in the direction of "increasing" value - that is, uphill. I t terminates when it reaches a peak where no neighbour has a higher value.

Hill climbing is sometimes called **greedy local search** because it grabs a good neighbour state without thinking ahead about where to go next.

Hill climbing often fail to find a goal because they can get stuck on local maxima.

## Simulated Annealing

**hill-climbing** algorithm -> it can get stuck on a local maximum

**pure random walk**, i.e., moving to a successor chosen uniformly at random from the set of successors -> extremely inefficient.

Simulated annealing combines hill climbing with a random walk. Simulated annealing is quite similar to hill climbing. Instead of picking the *best* move, however, it picks a *random* move. If the move improves the situation, it is always accepted.

Simulated annealing was first used extensively to solve VLSI layout problems in the early 1980s.

## Genetic Algorithm

Before introduce genetic algorithm, we should know what is "Local beam search". The **local beam search** algorithm keeps track of *k* states rather than just one. It begins with *k* randomly generated states. At each step, all the successors of all *k* states are generated. If any one is a goal, the algorithm halts.

Genetic algorithm (GA) is a variant of stochastic beam search in which successor state are generated by combining *two* parent states rather than by modifying a single state. (類似染色體分離那種)

Like beam searches, GAs begin with a set of *k* randomly generated states, called the population. Each state, or individual, is represented as a string over a finite alphabet -- most commonly, a string of 0s and 1s.
